- FIFO stands for First In, First Out.
- Used as a data structure to manage the buffer in serial port communication.
- Follows the principle that the first data item entered (enqueued) is the first to be processed (dequeued).
- New data is added to the back (tail) of the queue.
- Existing data is removed from the front (head) of the queue.
- data is therefore processed in a predictable way (first element is first processed)
- is used when buffering data for serial communication
