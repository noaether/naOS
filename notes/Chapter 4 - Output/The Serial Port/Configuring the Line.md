- serial port
	- speed used for sending data (bitrate)
	- yes/no error checking (parity bit, stop bits)
	- number of bits that represent a unit of data (data bits)
- line : configure how data is sent over the port
	- [[The Serial Port|serial port]] has I/O port *line command port* used for config ^2bcde2
	- 1st : Set speed for sending data
		- serial port has internal clock : 115200 Hz
		- setting speed = sending divisor to serial port
		- 115200 / 2 = 57600 Hz -> 1 result = 2 clock cycles (in, out)
		- divisor : 16 bit number, 8 bits at a time
			- send 0x80 to [[Configuring the Line#^2bcde2|line command port]] : Expect 2\*8 bits
			- [[Configuring the Line#^a4e728|see code]]
	- 2nd : Way that data should be sent
		- done by sending a [[Configuration Bytes|Configuration byte]]
			- will use 0x03 meaning lenght of 8 bits, no parity, one stop bit and break control disabled

| d    | Enables (`d = 1`) or disables (`d = 0`) DLAB                |

| prty | The number of parity bits to use                            |
| s    | The number of stop bits to use (`s = 0` equals 1, `s = 1` equals 1.5 or 2) |
| dl   | Describes the length of the data                            |รง
