- memory mapped I/O and I/O ports
	- mem-mapped : you can write to a specific address and hardware will be updated with the new data (e.g. text on [[The Framebuffer]]) ^e3e39e
	- i/o ports : assembly instructions in/out must be used to communicate with the hardware.  ^067574
		- `out` takes 2 parameters, address and data
		- `in` takes 1 parameter, address and returns data
		- *comparable to using sockets with servers*
		- blinking rectangle on [[The Framebuffer]] is example of hardware controlled with i/o ports
